# Assignment: Persist app to database
## Using an external database to persist data

Your task is to move the content of your website to a service that stores data and use that service to source data

## Set up your environment
 - In order to activate this environment, you will need to redownload the node_modules from the package.json file
 - Run `npm install` to install the node packages
 - Run `npm start` to start your webserver
 - Note that the firebase libraries are already being used so you do not need to expliclty download them again
 - This should be it: you can make all of your changes in the src/index.js file and your main 

## Requirements

1. Create a realtime firebase database to use for your application
 1. Go to Google Firebase and create your own realtime database following [these instructions](https://css-tricks.com/intro-firebase-react/#article-header-id-4)
2. Create a file in the src folder called firebase.js that contains all of the configuring needed to connect to Firebase 


1. Your webpage should have all of the functionality of your assignment 1 site, including
	1. Header and footer
	2. Blog posts
	3. Other content pages (e.g. About Us)
	4. Links that open blog posts
	5. Validations in the contact us form (extra credit)
	6. Comments (extra credit)
2. (extra credit) You can also create a new page that contains all of the information people fill out when someone submits the contact us page. In short, in addition to all of the validations that you have done for the contact us page, on submit the website should go to the home page, and a link on the footer should lead to a page that displays all of the contact us submissions.

## Things to consider
1. Think about the different React Components that will  be a part of your app. For example, a header and a footer would make great React Components. Check the starter code for suggestions on where to go with this.
2. Think about how you are going to display a new page/blog post via a link. You will need to capture a click event for a link and use that to modify the state of the component you have that contains your content.
3. Think about how to design the component that will contain all of the contact us form submissions. This component will have state that is being added to every time someone successfully submits a contact us form. Also consider the contact us form as itâ€™s own react component
4. Think about where you are going to contain the data from the blog posts and the rest of the pages. For this assignment containing each blog post in its own component and then creating a component that switches between those components would be great. Check the starter code for some ideas with this.
